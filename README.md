# LSEngine

An OpenGL renderer heavily inspired by https://github.com/neokabuto/OpenTKTutorialContent



### Before use

* Change working directory in project settings (I'm using my paths on my computer)



### TODO

* Fix lights (shadows not working properly)

* Add cascaded shadow maps (currently only one **NOT WORKING PROPERLY (yet)**)

* Add volumetric light

* Add support for multiple light sources (currently only one works properly with shadowmaps)
